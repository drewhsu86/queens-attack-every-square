    <p>
      On an N x N chessboard, how do we place the mininum number of queens to attack every square on the board? (Queens attack in a straight line and diagonally.)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I solved it using depth first search (DFS) but it is very slow.</li>
      <li>I tried to trim my DFS tree by not continuing a search if the number of queens is already higher than the amount in the current optimal solution stored.</li>
      <li>Currently N = 7 takes a minute, and N = 8 takes a long time (10s of minutes). Without trimming, N = 5 takes a minute and N = 6 takes a long time.</li>
    </ul>
